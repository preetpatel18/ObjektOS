# ObjektOS Project

ObjektOS is a simple tokenizer and parser for mathematical expressions. The project consists of a Lexer that tokenizes input strings into recognizable tokens and a Parser that processes these tokens for further analysis or execution.

## Project Structure

```

│   ├── Lexer.js       # Contains the Lexer class for tokenizing input strings

```

## Lexer

The `Lexer` class is responsible for breaking down input strings into tokens. It identifies different types of tokens such as numbers, operators, and whitespace. The tokens are stored in an array for further processing.

### Usage

To use the Lexer, instantiate it with an input string and call the `tokenize` method:

```javascript
const { Lexer } = require('./src/Lexer');

const lexer = new Lexer("3 + 5");
const tokens = lexer.tokenize();
console.log(tokens);
```

## Parser

The `Parser` class will analyze the tokens generated by the `Lexer`. It will likely include methods to build a syntax tree or perform other parsing tasks. (Details to be added once implemented.)

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```
npm install
```
